when settigng python to 3.7, installation succeeds; but run fails; python 3.7 does not have Literal from Typing.

using cuda 12.1.1 (as 3dgs repo suggests) let dream gaussian setup fail altogether.


using cuda 12.1.1 with python 3.8 will complain about cuda version not set during env install.

note that the nightly of cuda 11.6 is indeed deprecated, explaining previous error when trying to install
that one: https://pytorch.org/blog/deprecation-cuda-python-support/

errors:

https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/RELEASE.md#release-compatibility-matrix


when not specifying python version, installation process will default to 3.12, causing this error:

specifying python 3.9 cannot resolve dependencies for specified torch version...
